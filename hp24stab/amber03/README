This contains input script and coordinates for hp24stab simulations using Amber03
This force field is better at folding alpha helices than Amber99SB 

CUDA has the script to run on a CUDA device
OPENCL has the script to run on an OpenCL device

Set the CudaDevice or OpenCLDevice to the right number for your device

sim1 through sim4 have the results of 4 different simulations run using the CUDA version of OpenMM 6.3:
the eps is the result of Timeline -> Calculate Secondary Structure in VMD for about 800 ns of simulation written every 2 ns

rmsd_helix1.csv calculates backbone rmsd of helix 1 using Jeff Kinnisson's definition in rmsdh1.tcl
rmsd_helix2.csv similarly for helix 2 using rmsdh2.tcl
rmsd_all.csv is the protein starting at helix 1 and ending at helix 2 using rmsdall.tcl
